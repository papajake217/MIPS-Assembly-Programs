# MIPS-Assembly-Programs

Various MIPS assembly programs I wrote. The files contain functions that perform different tasks and are expected to be called in a separate file (sometimes in specific formats as well)


## Block Cipher 
Encrypt and decrypt messages using a block cipher

## Graph 
Constructs a graph with nodes and edges. The graph models people and their relationships with each other.

## Polynomials 
Create polynomial structures. Sort, add, multiply them.

## Rotate Matrices 
Rotate matrices formatted in text files.

## Utilities 
Validate arguments, converts strings to integers, decode I-Type instructions, convert hexadecimal string to 32-bit floating point number
in IEE 754 format, and verify a hand in a custom card game.
